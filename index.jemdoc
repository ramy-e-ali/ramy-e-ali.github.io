== About Me
I am a Staff Researcher in the Multi-media and Cellular lab at Samsung, San Diego working on next generation wireless communication and machine learning systems. I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Electrical Engineering Department, University of Southern California working with [https://www.avestimehr.com/ Prof. Salman Avestimehr] from 2020 to 2022. 
I currently work on secure and private machine learning, model compression and wireless communications.
