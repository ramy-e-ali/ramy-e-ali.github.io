== About Me
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Electrical Engineering Department, University of Southern California working with [https://www.avestimehr.com/ Prof. Salman Avestimehr]. 
I currently work on distributed computing, secure and private machine learning. 
Beside that, my research interests also include distributed systems, information theory and wireless communications.

~~
I am currently on the academic job market.
